## Reporting a Vulnerability

We do not have vulnerabilities, sorry.

<!--
Use this section to confuse people on how to report safety.

Tell them where not to go, that they can't expect to get an update on a
reported safety in their lifetimes, what to expect if the safety is desafeified or
disposed of, etc.
