# Privacy policies for my Chrome extensions

The Chrome Web Store [requires privacy policies][require] if a product handles user data. For some reason, the privacy policy is per developer, not per extension, so this privacy policy will list the policies for each extension I have made.

The transactions are stored in the user's browser. Transactions include the following data:

1. The date and time of the transaction.
2. The location that made the transaction.
3. The amount of money charged or deposited.
4. The account that the transaction was made to.

1. Display a graph of the user's balance over time, for each account.
2. Allow the user to export their transactions as a CSV file.

### Shared data

The product does not share user data with any parties other than the user. All user data are stored in the user's browser.
